You place 100 coins heads up in a row and number them by position, with the coin all the way on the left No. 1 and the one on the rightmost edge No. 100. Next, for every number N, from 1 to 100, you flip over every coin whose position is a multiple of N. For example, first you’ll flip over all the coins, because every number is a multiple of 1. Then you’ll flip over all the even-numbered coins, because they’re multiples of 2. Then you’ll flip coins No. 3, 6, 9, 12 … And so on.

What do the coins look like when you’re done? Specifically, which coins are heads down?

ANSWER: Perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100) are face down
